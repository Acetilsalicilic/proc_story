# Procedural Story
This is a silly nameless game.

It's a text-based RPG inspired on Dwarf Fortress' world simulation.

It's meant to be my take on procedural generation and simulation of world and story, to make a "unique" playing experience, like DF. I'm not a genius like Tarn, so I just want to simulate some basic story, with people in it with different reaces, families, relationships, objects, etc., so they interact for some years and places get built and peolple populate them, and you can explore those places and talk to people and fight. Obviously not tracking even the eyelids, of course.

Yeah, it feels like DF's Adventure Mode. Leave me alone. It's my take on the genre.

## Features
These are the features that I'm imagining:

### Procedural simulation
- Generation of basic terrain
- Generation of some starting families, with two "original partners" that create whole families for the time the generation is run.
- Simulation of people's interactions based on their traits and characteristics.
- Simulation of unique events
- The creation of interesting places to visit, with people in them.

### Stuff to interact with
- People as NPCs from different races, with thoughts, personalities, belongings, and actions, with the ability to talk to them.
- New places generated based on story simulation
- Objects to collect

### Gameplay
- Creation of a main character
- Three modes: Exploring, Talking, Fighting
- Interaction with NPCs and furnitures
- The story should continue endlessly until your MC dies.

## Tech stack
Currently, it's being developed on Python. I know something like this is very resource-intensive. But let's be honest, I won't even come near to finishing it.

I chose python cause of ease of use. I don't want to fight with C++ quirks or C convoluted way of managing stuff. If performance becomes an issue, I might migrate to Java or smth.

## Running
Why would you want to run this thing?


**UPDATE:** For now, only the family tree procedural generation kinda works. Go to _proc_gen_ branch for more info. The code is there.
